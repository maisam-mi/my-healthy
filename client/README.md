# Vue 3 with Vite 4 & Quasar 2 Template

This is a template for a Vue 3 project using the [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) build tool.

## Usage

To use this template, run the following command to generate a new project based on this template:

```
npx degit hossaini310/vv3-quasar-templ my-project
```

This will create a new directory called my-project that contains the files from this template. Next, navigate to the new directory with `cd my-project` and install the required dependencies with `npm install`. Once the dependencies are installed, the website can be started with `npm run dev` which will start a development server with hot reloading enabled. For production builds, you can use `npm run build` which will create a minified version of your application in the dist directory.

### Setup

The following steps are required to set up and use this template:

1. Generate a new project based on this template with the command:
   `npx degit hossaini310/express-templ my-project`
2. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

Once the development server has started, you can access the application in your browser at http://localhost:8080. For production builds, you can use `npm run build` which will create a minified version of your application in the dist directory.
